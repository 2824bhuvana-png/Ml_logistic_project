# Machine Learning Classification Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating three machine learning models to classify a given dataset.

## 📌 Models Used
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Random Forest Classifier  
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📊 Project Workflow

### *1. Data Loading*
- The dataset was loaded using pandas.
- Basic structure of data was inspected.

### *2. Data Preprocessing*
- Missing values were checked and handled.
- Categorical features (if any) were encoded.
- Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler.

### *3. Train-Test Split*
- The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

### *4. Model Training*
Each model was trained on the training data:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVM

### *5. Accuracy Comparison*
Accuracy on the test dataset:
- Logistic Regression: *X%*
- Random Forest: *Y%*
- SVM: *Z%*

(Replace with your actual results)

### *6. Best Model Selection*
Based on accuracy values, the best performing model was selected.

### *7. Saving the Best Model*
- The best model was saved using pickle.
- This file can be loaded later for predictions.
