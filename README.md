Project Workflow

1. Import Libraries

Essential Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are imported.


---

2. Load the Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Pandas and checked for:

Missing values

Data types

Basic statistical summary



---

3. Data Pre-processing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical features (if any)

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Splitting dataset into Train and Test sets



---

4. Model Training

You train the following models:

1. Logistic Regression


2. Random Forest Classifier


3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)



Each model is fitted using the training data.


---

5. Model Evaluation

For all three models:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report


are generated.


---

6. Bar Chart Comparison (Step 7)

A bar graph is plotted comparing accuracy of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.


---

7. Conclusion (Step 8)

A short conclusion is written:

Which model performed best?

Why is it better?

When can it be used?

🔹 Results Summary

Model	Accuracy

Logistic Regression	Your value
Random Forest	Your value
SVM	Your value


The model with the highest accuracy is considered the best for this dataset.
